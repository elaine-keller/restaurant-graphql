# GraphQL Restaurant Data Exercise

<h3>Using GraphQL to query and update data</h3>
Creating multi-tier applications means building multiple API endpoints to handle different data operations. The more complex your application becomes, the harder it is to maintain all these endpoints. GraphQL aims to reduce this complexity by providing a simpler view of data and making it easier to query it. 

This exercise sets up GraphQL for restaurant data and then adds mutations to get and update these data. 

The following methods under the "root" object are implemented:

- restaurant: This gets a single restaurant based on a provided ID. 
- restaurants: This gets a list of all restaurants. 
- setrestaurant: This creates a new restaurant. 
- Deleterestaurant: This deletes a restaurant based on the provided id.
- editrestaurant: This updates a restaurant based on the provided id.
